# Tsunami-Travel-Time-Globe-Projection-
This project simulates tsunami travel time (TTT) from a hypothetical Mw 8.8 megathrust earthquake along the Java subduction zone, using seismic parameters from PUSGEN. The COMCOT model applies nonlinear shallow water equations with a modified leap-frog scheme for accurate wave propagation.
